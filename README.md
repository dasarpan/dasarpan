### Hello everyone! üëã

My name is Arpan Das, and I‚Äôm looking for work as a software developer.

I have an MS in Computer Science (Data Science Engineering Track), ME in Engineering Management, and BS in Computer Engineering. üéì  

I started with C++, have done projects in Java, and primarily work in Python on projects that involve machine learning or AI. I do also enjoy OOP and the use of OO patterns to help speed up my programming. üñ•Ô∏è
