### Hi there 👋

I’m a software developer with an MS in Computer Science (Data Science Engineering Track), ME in Engineering Management, and BS in Computer Engineering. 🎓  

I started with C++, and have done projects in Java, but primarily work in Python on projects that involve machine learning or AI. 🖥️  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a website that can teach introductory programming in Python.
